> **⚠️ IMPORTANT - PROJECT IN DEVELOPMENT:**
> This project is currently in active development phase. Due to health and financial limitations, it was not possible to conduct on-site testing with communities in Guinea-Bissau at this time. The functionalities and impact described in this document will be demonstrated through technical videos showing the system in operation. The goal is to validate the concept and architecture before field implementation, which will be carried out as soon as conditions allow.

## 🌍 About the Project
