Moransa: Hope in Code for Guinea-Bissau with Gemma 3n

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT - PROJECT IN DEVELOPMENT:**
> This project is currently in active development phase. Due to health and financial limitations, it has not been possible to conduct in-person testing with communities in Guinea-Bissau at this time. The functionalities and impact described in this document will be demonstrated through technical videos showing the system in operation. The goal is to validate the concept and architecture before field implementation, which will be carried out as soon as conditions allow.

1. The Spark: A Promise Born from Loss

This project was not born from a technical challenge, but from a tragedy that echoes to this day. In an isolated village in my Guinea-Bissau, a woman and her unborn child lost their lives during childbirth. The cause was not an untreatable medical complication, but a dirt road that the rain had made impassable. Priests tried to help, but the car couldn't get through. They arrived by motorcycle too late and, without medical knowledge, all they could do was pray beside her for eight hours.

I heard this story, told by a priest in tears during Sunday mass. From that day on, the helplessness I felt transformed into a relentless search for a solution. How could we bring vital knowledge to where roads don't reach? How could we put the power of a specialist in the hands of a community agent, a midwife, a farmer?

The answer seemed distant, until the launch of Gemma 3n. A powerful, multimodal AI model and, crucially, capable of functioning 100% offline. It was the missing piece. The technology that could fulfill the promise I made to myself: to build something that would bring real help to my moransa.

In Guinea-Bissau, "moransa" is more than a house; it's our refuge, the place where our soul rests, where another's pain is our pain. This project is called Moransa because it was born from my home, from my pain, to serve as a refuge of knowledge and hope for other communities, in Guinea-Bissau and around the world. It's the materialization of hope in code.

2. The Solution: An Offline Community Assistance Ecosystem

Moransa is an Android application that functions as a complete community assistance system, designed to operate in environments with zero or intermittent connectivity. It addresses critical challenges in health, education, agriculture, accessibility, and environmental sustainability, using Gemma 3n as its main AI engine, executed locally through Ollama.

2.1. Technical Architecture: Robust, Offline and Intelligent

Moransa's architecture was designed to be resilient and efficient on devices with limited resources, ensuring that help reaches where it's most needed.

• Frontend (Flutter): Ensures a native, high-performance user experience on Android devices, with an interface designed to be intuitive and accessible.
• Backend (FastAPI): A local, lightweight, and asynchronous Python server that manages business logic and serves as a bridge to the AI engine.
• AI Engine (Gemma 3n via Ollama): The heart of the system. Ollama allows us to package and run Gemma 3n reliably and locally, eliminating any internet dependency for AI functionalities.
• Local Database: Stores the corpus of validated translations, educational materials, and other essential data for offline operation.

2.2. Innovative Use of Gemma 3n: Precision and Adaptation

The genius of Gemma 3n is its flexibility. Instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach, we specialize the model for each task, adjusting its parameters to optimize results. This shows a deep and deliberate use of technology.

Module	Use Cases	temperature	Technical Justification
🏥 Health	Emergency diagnosis, childbirth	0.2 - 0.3	Maximum precision. In life-or-death situations, responses must be factual, deterministic, and protocol-based, with no room for creativity.
🌾 Agriculture	Pest diagnosis, soil health	0.4	Technical precision. Recommendations must be scientifically correct, but with flexibility to adapt to varied farmer descriptions.
📚 Education	Story generation, lesson plans	0.6 - 0.7	Controlled creativity. Ideal for creating engaging and adapted educational content, encouraging learning without sacrificing factual accuracy.
♿ Accessibility	Environment description, simplification	0.5	Balance. Description needs to be factual, but with enough naturalness to be easily understood.

3. The Revolution: Gamified Community Validation

Our greatest technical and social innovation is the Community Validation System. We realized that for low-resource languages like Creole, Balanta, or Fula, no AI model, however advanced, can alone capture the richness and cultural precision.

Therefore, we inverted the paradigm:
1. Gemma 3n Generates the Challenge: The model generates relevant phrases and scenarios in Portuguese (e.g., "Apply direct pressure to the wound").
2. The Community Translates and Validates: Native speakers translate these phrases into their local languages through a gamified interface.
3. Collective Wisdom Creates the Corpus: Users vote on each other's translations. A translation is only approved and added to "Rescuer Mode" (the offline emergency mode) after reaching a consensus threshold.

This system, powered by a robust backend with PostgreSQL and a unified Flutter interface, transforms users from mere information consumers into active knowledge builders. It ensures that every piece of information in emergency mode is not only technically correct but culturally authentic and validated by those who matter most: the community itself.

4. Impact Modules: From Theory to Practice

Moransa is a modular platform, where each component addresses a specific challenge:
• 🏥 First Aid System: Provides step-by-step emergency protocols, with special focus on childbirth and maternal-child health.
• 📚 Educational System: Allows teachers in remote areas to generate lesson plans, stories, and exercises adapted to local reality.
• 🌾 Agricultural System: Helps farmers diagnose plant diseases and receive advice on sustainable practices.
• ♿ Accessibility System: Uses Gemma 3n's multimodal capabilities to describe environments for the visually impaired and simplify texts.
• 🌳 Environmental Sustainability System: Enables participatory monitoring of local biodiversity through species identification by image.
• 🌍 Translation and Preservation System: Serves as the backbone of the validation system, creating the first large-scale digital corpus for Guinea-Bissau languages.
